# Prettier Config

Creating a Prettier config .prettierrc file is a lot of copying and pasting from the docs. Or, you can use this tool to select the options you want and click a button to generate the file for you. Any options not selected will not be included.

This app was an experiment to try Hyperapp and Parcel.

To run locally:
`yarn`
`yarn start`
